General Tips

Tools: Use Qiskit (quantum circuits), PennyLane (QML focus), and TensorFlow Quantum (hybrid DL integration). Leverage your DL tools (e.g., PyTorch) for classical components.
# Time Management: Allocate ~10-15 hours/week: 40% theory, 40% coding, 20% deployment.
Deployment: Share projects on GitHub or a portfolio site. Use Jupyter notebooks for clarity and visualization.
# Hardware: Start with simulators; transition to IBM Quantum’s free cloud access in Week 10.
Leverage ML/DL: Relate quantum concepts to your ML/DL intuition (e.g., variational circuits as neural layers, quantum kernels as feature spaces).
